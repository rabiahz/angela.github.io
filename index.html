        <p>When you left this town, with your windows down<br> And the wilderness inside<br> Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass <br> 'Til the road and sky align<br> The strangers in this town,<br> They raise you up just to cut you down<br> Oh Angela it's a long time coming<br> And your Volvo lights lit up green and white<br> With the cities on the signs<br> But you held your course to some distant war<br> In the corners of your mind<br> From the second time around<br> The only love I ever found<br> Oh Angela it's a long time coming<br> Home at last<br> Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms<br> With your fingers in a fist<br> Did you hear the notes, all those static codes<br> In the radio abyss?<br> Strangers in this town,<br> They raise you up just to cut you down<br> Oh Angela it's a long time coming<br> Oh Angela spent your whole life running<br> Home at last<br> Home at last<br> Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you<br> Angela, on my knees, I belong, I believe<br> Home at last<br> Home at last<br> Home at last<br> Home at last<br> Home at last<br>
